# BC-Calculator
ANTLR4 grammar and visitor class for generating a parser for major features of the bc language. <br>
Basic expressions, relational expressions, for loops, while loops, if/else statements, functions, and scopes for functions are implemented. The parse tree generated by ANTLR is evaluated with visitors in MyVisitor.java. Function.java is a class containing information about a function including the parameter names and the function context. <br>
With antlr4 installed, the code can be run with: <br>
antlr -visitor BC.g4 && javac MyVisitor.java BC*.java Function.java. <br>
Testing can then be performed with java BC [testname].bc
